We study scenarios of operations that require multiple dispatch,
especially in the context of extensibility (say modular extension). We
begin with the example from the following paper: MultiJava: Modular
Open Classes and Symmetric Multiple Dispatch for Java by Curtis
Clifton, Gary T. Leavens, Craig Chambers, and Todd Millstein. We also
cover an operation with type dependencies between argument and result.
